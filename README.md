# DeFiAT; Decentralized Finance And Trading
Reactive Network and Smart Contracts have provided many innovations for the DeFi world. I have already participated in ParsiQ bounties and Defi projects' bounties. Balancer DeFi has already worked on providing innovative flexibility in their pools for different purposes. I found that it would be a perfect application for Reactive Smart Contracts to improve already built pools and also create new innovative pools in Balancer.

- Reactive Smart Contracts can be used for stabilizing tokens that need to be pegged 1:1 in Balancer Compossable pools such as Wrapped Staked Eth : Eth.

- Spot prices changes is crucial in linear math applied in Linear and Boosted pools. Reactive Smart Contracts can be implemented for this purpose too and save lots of gas fees.

- Reactive Smart Contracts can be useful for Circuit Breakers (when drastic changes happen in prices) and also for Smart Order Routes in Balancer swappers.

And finally my two ideas about new pools:
- "Dynamic Weighted Pools" that is an improved version of Balancer Weighted Pools.
- DeFiAT; Implementing trading strategies (even customizeable by traders who want to enter DeFi too) with the help of Reactive Smart Contracts to change weights in the Dynamic Weighted Pools.
