My proposal contains different parts, from rarity to general distribution.
I will describe it along with the python code written for the distribution.

_Note: My idea about colors is to choose randomly at first and let the owner decide. Some items can be colored, such as hair, beard, lipstick, and even background color. My idea is to define some color sets for each item. At the time of NFT creation, a random color will attach to the items, and there could be an option for the owners (if they want to change the colors) to choose from the color-set and color the items with just paying the gas fee. Although I have an additional idea about the background color that will describe it lastly cause it's outside my python code distribution._

So, here's my idea in detail and how the code helps distribution:

I haven't access to the attributes, so I created a database by myself. The [Attributes Excel file](https://github.com/JitrZ/Badger-NFT-Gitcoin-Contest/blob/main/Attributes.xlsx) is a pure database including 5 Base Types and 63 attributes along with their 6 Categories, Count (that is zero at first), Maximum possible, and Rarity (if the attribute is rare or not).

In general, the proposal includes three different distribution ways:
- The maximum limit for rare things
- Distribution of different items based on Normal (_Natural_) Distribution
- Uniform distribution for same items
